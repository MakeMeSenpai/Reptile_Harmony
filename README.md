## Checklist

### MVP TODO:
- Setup 
    - [x] Skateboard: A templated website that can be easily visualized and comprehended as to what it's supposed to do. This should be live on github pages, and have completed information for basic set up.
    - [x] Bike: A flask ran website that includes main functionality, and has all art and UI/UX features. (must be based off XD) https://xd.adobe.com/view/c4af0c29-2221-487d-7124-68d2737bc652-b29e/
    - [ ] Car: add improved functionality, and stretched functionality that makes the website actually usable apart from the bikes example uses. From here, you should make the website live with a proper domain name. finish Django refactoring (must be based off XD)
    - [ ] **Stretch** Limo: Create an environment in which web traffic can poor in, as well as adding ads, bug fixes, and live updates. Create a way for live updates to be made without the need of yourself or another developer. (Idea: give admin abilities in which they are allowed to edit certain aspects of the website. If this works this can also be used for future websites


### Potential Features:
- My Feature 
    - [ ] do something awesome I guess

### Previous Updates:
{Last Update: 02/11/20}
- ≥0.5.0
    - Starting a new django project, while reviewing django concepts and reorganizing files in order to try and fix what is now broken. 

- ≥0.3.6
    - Used django to try and implement a function website. Skeleton was functional, up until a build error, in which is causing our project to not be able to run. This has been the main reason why this project has been halted, other than the fact that I just don't have the time to deal with it.

**Reptile Harmony!**
A website for buying and trading bearded dragons!
This website was made for a single owned business, and I hope to put only my best work into 
this, given that it's my first real freelancer job. 

TODO:
Skatebaord: A templated website that can be easily visualized and comprehended 
as to what it's supposed to do. This should be live on github pages, and have completed 
information for basic set up. √√√

Bike: A flask runned website that includes main functionality, and has all art 
and UI/UX features. (must be based off XD) https://xd.adobe.com/view/c4af0c29-2221-487d-7124-68d2737bc652-b29e/

Car: add improved functionality, and strechted functionality that makes the 
website actually 
usable apart from the bikes example uses. From here, you should make the 
website live with a proper 
domain name.

Stretch Limo: Create an enviroment in which web traffic can poor in, as well 
as adding ads, bug 
fixes, and live updtes. Create a way for live updates to be made without the 
need of yourself or 
another developer. (Idea: give admin abilities in which they are allowed to 
edit certain aspects of 
the website. If this works this can also be used for future websites)
